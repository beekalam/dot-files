##
# between: print the lines of a file that are between match $1 and match $2.
#
# Example to show lines of foo.txt that are between the lines 'hello' and 'goodbye':
#
#     cat foo.txt | between 'hello' 'goodbye'
#
# This prints multiple sections, if they exist.
#
# This script uses bash 3.2+ pattern matching for strings.
#
# This is similar to `sed` which can print a section
# between two regular expressions (inclusive) like this:
#
#     sed -n '/hello/,/goodbye/p'
