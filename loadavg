# Show system load average info on every system we care about.

# This script tries the following:
#
#   * Run `cat /proc/loadavg` which is typical on Linux, Ubuntu, etc.
#   * Run `sysctl vm.loadavg` which is typical on BSD, OSX, etc.
#   * Exit with an error
#
# This script normalizes the output to be three numbers,
# then any extra info provided by the commands.
#
#   * 1-minute load average.
#   * 5-minute load average
#   * 10-minute load avegage
#   * Any extra info, e.g. Linux provides more info
